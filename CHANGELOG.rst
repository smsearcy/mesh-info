Added
^^^^^

* Start a changelog (`#21 <https://github.com/smsearcy/mesh-info/issues/21>`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Moved default data folder (`#18 <https://github.com/smsearcy/mesh-info/issues/18>`_)

  For *production*, moved from ``/usr/local/share/pymeshmap`` to ``/var/lib/pymeshmap``,
  to be better aligned with Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
  Moved RRD files into the ``rrd`` subfolder (i.e. ``/var/lib/pymeshmap/rrd``).

  For *development*, moved data folder into ``data`` subfolder (``~/.local/share/pymeshmap/data``),
  in preparation for needing a cache directory.
  Moved RRD files into the ``rrd`` subfolder, to mirror production (``~/.local/share/pymeshmap/data/rrd``).

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fix parse error due to changed tunnel data in nightly firmware (API v1.10).
  All nodes will now just report their tunnel count,
  so a 0 instead of "No" if the tunnel plugin is not installed.
  (`#23 <https://github.com/smsearcy/mesh-info/issues/23>`_)


0.2.0 - 2022-04-11
------------------
